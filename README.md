I develop software and climb. Proficient at both, I have some advice that could apply to either activity:

* Check your knots and always have a backup.
* Gear freaking is a distraction.
* Muscle memory and good technique will get you there faster.
* Being on the sharp end is more exciting.

I like fifth class terrain and first class functions.  
I like boulder problems, route finding and algebraic data types.  
I like leave no trace and persistent data structures.  
I like rest days and lazy evaluation.  
I like pattern matching.
