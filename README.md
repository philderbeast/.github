I develop software and climb. Proficient at both, I have some advice that could
apply to either activity:

* Check your knots and always have a backup.
* Gear freaking is a distraction.
* Muscle memory and good technique will get you there faster.
* Being on the sharp end is more exciting.

When I first started working as a software developer, the team I joined was
developing for DOS with Turbo Pascal on the 80486. I’ve learnt a lot since then.

I’ve been disorientated debugging objects with nested state and shared state.
Sure the scope of changes can be restricted among methods partitioned into
public, private, protected and internal groups but that doesn’t really help that
much.

I have reorientated towards first class functions, algebraic data types,
persistent data structures and lazy evaluation. Development life is much simpler
now.
